                                Neural connections have become more and more common in this day and age, people have been uploading themselves into machines as Human Intelligence. Some choose to do some others did not get a choice. <br/>
                                You are monitoring ships for the Argus company and trying to fix the uncontrolled H.I ships. Using the Eno Phone technology to get a closer connection to this intelligence and guide them.<br/>
                                While looking into a ship that deviaded from it's path you discorver new things about the vessel and why he got uploaded in there. Will you help this ship become it's old self again or will you send it back to Argus for repairing and deleting the original Human Intelligence.<br/><br/>
                                
                                The game is originally meant to be played with the Eno Phones or other EEG scanners. If you do not own such device the game will be played with random data instead of your brain activity.
